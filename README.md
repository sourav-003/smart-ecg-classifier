# SmartECG: A Comprehensive Approach to Automated Classification of Cardiac and COVID-19 Patients Using 12-Lead ECG Images

This project, **SmartECG**, focuses on the development of an intelligent system capable of automated classification of **cardiac conditions and COVID-19** using 12-lead ECG images. It integrates a wide spectrum of techniques including **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Transfer Learning, Explainable AI, and AutoML** to ensure robust and interpretable results. The aim is to provide a scalable diagnostic support tool that aids in early detection and monitoring of cardiovascular and COVID-19 patients.

## üìå Problem Statement
Accurate and automated classification of ECG signals is a critical challenge in modern healthcare. Manual interpretation by cardiologists is time-consuming and prone to variability. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of fast, reliable, and scalable diagnostic tools.  
SmartECG addresses these challenges by:
- Classifying **Abnormal Heartbeat, COVID-19, Myocardial Infarction (MI), MI History, and Normal** ECG patterns.  
- Leveraging deep learning and transfer learning models on ECG image datasets.  
- Enhancing interpretability using **Explainable AI** techniques.  
- Utilizing **AutoML** for hyperparameter optimization and model selection.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset consists of ECG images organized into five categories:
- **Abnormal HeartBeat**
- **COVID-19**
- **Myocardial Infarction (MI)**
- **MI History**
- **Normal**

The dataset is preprocessed and visualized to ensure balance and quality before training. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves:
- Distribution plots (Bar, Pie) of different classes  
- Image visualization for quality inspection  
- Dataset splitting into **train, validation, and test** sets

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
The project workflow is divided into several key stages:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Image loading and resizing  
- Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, scaling)  
- Normalization for neural network compatibility  

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Distribution of image categories  
- Class imbalance visualization  
- Correlation between categories and counts  

### 3. **Model Development**
Multiple approaches are explored:
- **Machine Learning Models:** SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
- **Deep Learning Models:** CNN, ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet  
- **Transfer Learning:** Pre-trained models fine-tuned on ECG data  
- **AutoML:** Automated hyperparameter tuning and model selection  

### 4. **Explainable AI (XAI)**
- Visualization with **Grad-CAM** to highlight regions of ECG images that influence model decisions  
- Interpretability for medical validation  

### 5. **Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC curves  
- Confusion matrices for class-wise performance
